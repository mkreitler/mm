Today:
-- Finish initial game design
-- Create "Practice Mode"

BASIC DESIGN:
1) Adventurers come to the dungeon

2) Player populates monsters to defeat them

3a) If player succeeds, he adds adventurers' gold to his treasure
3b) If player fails, adventurers steal some of his gold

NOTES
* Player summons monsters
    -- Only 1 Summon can be active at a time
    -- All Summons take the same amount of time, regardless of size
* Battle adventurers during the day, upgrade dungeon at night?
* Size of monsters determines how many fit in a room?
* Special abilities like Disease for rats, etc?
* Adventurer stats: Hit Points (HP), Armor, Special (special abilities)
* Monster stats: Size (if monster.size > adventurer.armor, monster can hurt adventurer), Special
